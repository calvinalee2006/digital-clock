### Summary
This digital clock was part of the mastermind program I attended to improve my skills as a
web developer. It was a bit more difficult becuase I added JavaScript to the project and 
through a lot of trial and error as well as reading, I finally got it to work. Showing the proper date in a 12-hour format.
